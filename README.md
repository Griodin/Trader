Objectives:
End: Buiding a Crypto Trading Bot (Optimistic Goal)
1: Build a Financial Chart with Indicators like EMA (Static Data)
	a: D3 seemed like a possible option
2: Link Chart to RealTime data from a exchange api
3: Store data in database for history tracking and trend analysis
4: If possible find back data for 2+ years or more.
5: Using the back data map out good buy/sell practice.
6: Develop a strategy to get my result.
7: Design a way to test strategy.
8: Design a way to future test strategy.
9: Impliment strategy.
	a: for strategy to go live it must be tested with back data, then live data. (Workflow)

This doesn't work but I am trying to get Nodejs, requirejs, d3, d3fc to all work together.
Open to suggestions, I am looking for simple.  This is only for learning how all these things work together.

for this first part, I am trying to build decent charts to read from a exchange api JSON or possibly back data from a database.
Inorder to get to the next step I need to figure out how to get the basic chart loaded.
